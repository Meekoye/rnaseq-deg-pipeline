# rnaseq-deg-pipeline
This repository contains a complete RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis pipeline using TPM normalization. It compares sensitive and resistant sample groups, calculates log2 fold changes, performs statistical testing with FDR correction, identifies significantly up- and down-regulated genes, and visualizes results using a volcano plot.
